Because we respect your privacy, we have instituted this Privacy Policy to ensure that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner. We reserve the right to change the provisions of this Privacy Policy at any time. We will alert you that changes have been made by indicating on the Privacy Policy the date it was last updated.

                    <h5>What this Privacy Policy Covers</h5>
                    <p class="text">This Privacy Policy covers how Universal Laser treats personal information that it collects and receives with respect to your use of the website located at www.ulsinc.com (the “Website’) and any services accessible through the Website (the “Services”). Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable such as your name, address, email address, phone number or other information about you when it is directly linked with your personally identifiable information. Personal information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect about the use of the Website or about a group or category of products, services or users, from which individual identities or other personal information is not attached or has been removed. This Privacy Policy does not apply to aggregate information. It also does not apply to any companies or websites that Universal Laser does not own or control, or to people that Universal Laser does not employ or manage.</p>

                    <h5>Personal Information</h5>
                    <p class="text">Universal Laser may collect personal information in a number of ways. We may collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us. For example, we may collect your name, user name, email address, telephone number, other contact and demographic information when you register, set up an account, fill out a form, submit a comment or contact us by email or other means. Also, we occasionally may ask you to complete online surveys about your activities, attitudes and interests with our products. These surveys help us serve you better and improve the usefulness of our Website. In conducting these surveys we may ask you for your name and email address. Personal information may also be collected if you participate in any interactive forums or features on the Website or through the Services. Universal Laser may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. When you use the Website, some information is also automatically collected, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring website, and your activity on the Website. We treat this information as personally information only if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only and not considered your personal information.</p>
